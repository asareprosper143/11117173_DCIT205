        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. 
            <br>The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits 
            <br>Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. 
            Computer science <br>involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, 
            the software systems that <br>support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that <br>behave reliably, correctly and ethically. 
            At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who <br>hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers 
            with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to<br> apply sound engineering principles to the development,
             construction and maintenance of computer programs.</p>
